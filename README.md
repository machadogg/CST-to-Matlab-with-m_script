# CST-to-Matlab-with-m_script

This repository is an improvement to cst-to-mat lab, on https://github.com/machadogg/cst-to-matlab

I added 4 generic matlab scripts to run with the output files from example.txt. The software is the same
from https://github.com/machadogg/cst-to-matlab, but with a few improvements to help to speed-up the plotting process in MATLAB.

YOU NEED PYTHON 3

Cheers
